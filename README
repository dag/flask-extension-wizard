Flask Extension Wizard
======================

A script that can generate Flask Extensions.  Just make sure to
have Flask installed before running that script.  It will prompt
you for a few things and then generate the basic stuff for you.

For Sphinx and git support, Sphinx and git have to be available.

Installation with a fresh virtualenv:

$ virtualenv env
$ env/bin/activate
$ easy_install Flask Sphinx
$ wget http://bit.ly/flask-extension-wizard
$ python make_flaskext.py

Then follow the instructions.
